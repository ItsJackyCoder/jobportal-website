This is a job platform with two user roles: recruiters and job seekers.Recruiters can post job openings to find the right candidates, while job seekers can browse listings, save their favorite positions, and submit applications. Both sides can create and update their personal profiles.

To access these interactive features, users must be signed in.
Visitors who arenâ€™t logged in can still explore job listings, but they wonâ€™t be able to save or apply for positions.
